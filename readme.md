## Basic rules (try to follow)

Do not worry! These are not super serious rules. Just few guidelines to keep in mind when working on your thread. Anyway, we will help you to get the tweets in correct way.

1. Make sure you have at least four papers related to the theme of epithelial mechanics.
2. Begin your thread with an interesting question related to the theme.
3. Use short sentences in each tweet, separated by blank spaces.
4. Feel free to use emojis like ➡️ or 🔙 to keep your tweets concise within the 280-character limit.
5. Always include images or videos with each tweet.
6. Mention the Twitter handles of the labs associated with the papers you are referencing.
7. Start and end your thread by tagging yourself so people know who you are.
8. While it's great to share your opinions or insights on the topic, please keep your tone positive. The internet is already filled with negativity.

## Process

1. You agree to write a thread on your chosen topic.
2. Create a story connecting multiple papers and also come up with a question.
3. Write the thread, considering the rules and guidelines mentioned above.
4. Send it to me via email at chaharenimesh@gmail.com.
5. I will refine it into a draft and send it back to you. If you agree, we will be ready to publish.
6. Twitter does not allow external links, so avoid including them in the thread. I will tweet all the papers separately in a citation-style format.
7. Then, I will tweet the thread linking to all the papers.
8. I typically publish this on Sundays.

## Example: First Draft

This is an example of an email I received from a delegate. If you prefer, you can use a Word document instead. We worked on this and transformed it into a proper thread, [check here](https://x.com/EpiMechFC/status/1708417266029576668?s=20).

1.    A paper published on @eLife described an optogenetic tool that manipulate morphological features of endothelial cells by spatial and temporal control of RhoGTPases in cell-cell adhesions, specifically adherens junctions (@EikeMahlandt, @joachimgoedhart).

Adherens junctions (AJs) are a protein complex composed by cadherins, catenins and other adaptor proteins, such as vinculin. In composition, epithelial and endothelial AJs only differ in the type of cadherin, where epithelial has E- cadherin and endothelial has VE-cadherin. But are they different in structure or morphology?

2.    In 2012, Huveneers et al. (@Huveneers_Lab, Johan de Rooij) described two states of AJs in endothelial cells: stable and remodeling. The stable state is characterized by actin cables parallel to the junctions and low force. The remodeling state exhibit actin cables colocalized with the junctions and is associated with high force.

3.    Additionally, in 2018, Efimova and Svitkina (@NadiaEfimova3) showed that in the stable state, AJs were indirectly connected to actin cables by a layer of branched actin. Therefore, proposing actin as a generator of a dynamic push-pull       system in AJs of endothelial cells.

4.    One year later, in 2019, Heuzé et al. (@BLadoux, @ReneMege) observed the same branched actin layer in AJs of epithelial cells (MDCK) and described the non-muscle myosin IIB (NMIIB) as its maintainer. Thus, indicating a huge similarity       of AJs between endothelial and epithelial cells.

Leading to the ultimate question: is endothelium a type of epithelium?


If you are interested in mechanobiology of endothelial cells, here is one good review to read: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02285-w (@ClaireDessalles, @BarakatLab)


(Could be something like this. We can discuss about the take home messages later)

## More explanation

There's no absolute rules for writing threads, but in my opinion, we should keep some ground rules considering people's interest and twitter/x algorithm.

People don't want to read the thread, let alone follow the account or read the papers. The statistics I have seen are super sad. For example, in one of these threads whopping 23 thousand people saw the first tweet, but only 1888 people saw the second tweet and further decrease. Therefore, it is very important to have very good first tweet.

Start the thread with a question, which is general and people care about. I see in many popular tweets, they space out the tweets with short sentences and blank spaces. Also, they have an attention grabbing image attached to it

One successful example is the following:

Another thing to know about Twitter is that it tends to reduce the visibility of tweets containing links leading outside of Twitter itself. This can be a bit inconvenient for us because we need to share links to research papers. To work around this, I've come up with a solution. Every day, I'll tweet the paper references in advance and then link them together in a thread. So, the thread will only include links to other tweets on Twitter. You don't need to worry about this part; I'll handle it myself.

A typical tweet will look like this:

- I'll tag the lab that conducted the research.
- I'll share a brief insight about the work.
- I'll include a representative image of the research.
- Finally, I'll quote retweet the citation, which contains the link to the paper
